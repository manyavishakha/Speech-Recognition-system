DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK: THIS PROJECT CONTAINS INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS PLATFORMS LIKE YOUTUBE, GOOGLE , META AI , CHAT GPT AND MANY OTHER WEBSITES. UNDERSTANDING THE GOAL WHAT WE HAVE TO BUILD, IT'S A COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT TRANSCRIBES SPOKEN LANGUAGE INTO SPEECH .
FOR THIS SCRIPT I TOOK HELP FROM MENTOR AND FROM THE YOUTUBE VIDEO. I GOT TO KNOW ABOUT ALL THESE FROM LINKDLN AND WHATSAPP GROUP WHICH KEEP US UPDATED BY PROVIDING THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THIS COURSE AND ALSO, OUR MENTOR HELPS US IN EVERY WAY TO MAKE US UNDERSTAND THE TASK EASYILY. THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM . A speech recognition system is a computer program that identifies and transcribes spoken language into text. It uses acoustic and language models to analyze audio signals and predict the likelihood of specific words or phrases. The system processes audio input, extracts features, and decodes them into text.

The primary function of a speech recognition system is to convert spoken words into written text, enabling humans to interact with machines using voice commands. This technology has numerous applications, including virtual assistants, speech-to-text systems, voice control, language translation, and accessibility tools.

Speech recognition systems rely on machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and statistical models to improve accuracy and robustness. They can be fine-tuned for specific languages, dialects, and accents, and can operate in real-time or offline modes. Overall, speech recognition systems have revolutionized human-computer interaction, making it more natural, intuitive, and accessible.
